# Intercom v2

[**Intercom**](https://www.intercom.com/) is an industry-leading, real-time business messaging platform, that allows you to bring together and manage all your customer life cycle activities on a single platform.

This document guides you in setting up Intercom as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Intercom data, which can then be routed to your RudderStack-supported data warehouse destination.

<div class="infoBlock">

  The Intercom v2 source leverages the <a href="https://airbyte.io/">Airbyte</a> API for ingesting the data.

All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a data warehouse destination.

- Under **Destination Settings**, set the **Table prefix**. RudderStack will create a table in your data warehouse with this prefix name and load all your Intercom data into it.

- Under **Schedule Settings**, set the **Run Frequency**. This option specifies how frequently the syncs will occur.

- Optionally, you can also specify the time of the sync by selecting the time under **Sync Starting At**. Then, click on **Next**.

That's it! Intercom is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from Intercom as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**, as shown:

## FAQs

#### How do I get the Intercom access token?

To get the Intercom access token, go to the **Your apps** section under **Intercom Developer Hub**. 

If you have already created an app, click on the **Authentication** option under **Configure**, as shown below. Here, you will find the access token under the workspace associated with your app.

For more details, refer to the Intercom [**support page**](https://help-desk-migration.com/help/get-intercom-api-access-token/).

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
